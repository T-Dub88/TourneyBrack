TourneyBrack is a tournament hosting application that facilitates real-time interactions between tournament participants and hosts.

Users can create a tournament that allows other users to sign up as participants, create tournament-exclusive participants for players that do not have the app, or mix both types of participants.

Users can sign up for a tournament using a randomly generated registration code created when a host creates the tournament. (Feature Pending)

Match results will update in real-time on all users' devices for seamless host and participant experiences.

Currently, Swiss matchmaking is supported, with more tournament styles to be implemented later.

Under the hood, the application uses Firebase Firestore and Authentication to facilitate all real-time user interactions and data storage.

The app is written exclusively in Kotlin, structured using MVVM and Clean Architecture. The UI is exclusively written using Jetpack Compose and implements a beautiful Material 3 design with a dynamic user-generated color scheme. (Some screen designs are still being implemented)
